backend: "I've been working with Ruby for about 4 years. I've written many Rails
  applications but also have experience with other lighter frameworks such as
  Grape, Sinatra and Cuba.  I've used Redis for caching data and also supporting
  job queue frameworks as Resque or Sidekiq.  My testing framework of choice is
  RSpec for most cases, althought for small projects MiniTest will do the job. I
  try to keep design as simple as possible, following good practices: keeping code
  DRY, respecting OOP principles, keeping test coverage above 90%, practicing
  TDD when I feel it's useful."

frontend: "Even thought I am not a pure frontend developer, I have written a
  fair amount of HTML templates, CSS stylesheets and javascript magic. I prefer
  to use out-of-the-box solutions like bootstrap and jquery that will get you a
  nice amount of value for little work. On some projects I've been required to
  learn React.js and collaborate with the frontend team, which I don't mind. I
  can cut simple designs and client-side behaviour for small to medium size
  applications, but I'm not the guy when it comes to flashy animated websites."

tools: "I'm a Linux and Vim user. I spend most of my working hours on my console
  typing commands and writing code, which I think explains my passion for
  server-side programming. I enjoy writing my own scripts for automating tasks
  and save work. This makes life much easier when it comes to dealing with Linux
  servers, where most real applications run."
